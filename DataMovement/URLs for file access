#  URLs for file access  #

Scoped URL
Encoded URL that permits temporary access to a staged file without granting privileges to the stage.

The URL expires when the persisted query result period ends (i.e. the results cache expires), which is currently 24 hours.

File URL
URL that identifies the database, schema, stage, and file path to a set of files. A role that has sufficient privileges on the stage can access the files.

Pre-signed URL
Simple HTTPS URL used to access a file via a web browser. A file is temporarily accessible to users via this URL using a pre-signed access token. The expiration time for the access token is configurable.
